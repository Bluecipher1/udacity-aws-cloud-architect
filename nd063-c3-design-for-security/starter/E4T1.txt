# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- disable ssh password authentication on the app server instance
- only allow inbound traffic for the Web server via the AppLoadBalancer SG
- disallow port 22 from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) for both the AppLoadBalancer and WebAppSG

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
The instance role policy for the web app instance currently allows all operations on all (*) S3 buckets. Restrict this to read-only access on the FreeRecipes S3 bucket.
