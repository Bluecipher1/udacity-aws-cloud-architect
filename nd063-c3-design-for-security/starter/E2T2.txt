Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
 There are numerous configuration issues which result in vulnerabilities:

S3 Buckets
The configured S3 buckets have no encryption enabled, do not restrict access to SSL requests and have no logging enabled.

EC2 Instances
The attached EBS volumes of the configured instances are not encrypted.

Application Load Balancers
The specified ALB does not redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

Security Groups
The configured security groups allow inbound traffic from all IP addressess for all ports (Allow All, 0.0.0.0/0)

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
S3 Buckets
    - enable logging by using the LoggingConfiguration property
    - configure bucket encryption by using the BucketEncryption property

EC2 Instances
    - enable EBS encryption by setting the AWS::EC2::Volume.Encrypted property to true

Application Load Balancers
    - define a redirect from HTTP (port 80) to HTTPS (port 443) using AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::ListenerRule

Security Groups
    - define more specific rules using AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup to restrict ingress traffic to known IPs or security groups
