Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The security group used to configure access to the web application (WebAppSG) allows inbound access on all ports and protocols (0.0.0.0/0). This should be constrained to only the 
prots and protocols needed for the functioning of the application. While access might be restricted in other layers and the access therefore currently restricted, it is important 
to properly configure at all application and infrastructure layers (Defense in Depth) to mitigate possible security gaps in other layers and increase the difficulty to hack the system.

# Poor practice 2
The S3 bucket policies are to open and violate the Principle of Least Privilege. InstanceRolePolicy-C3 allows all action on all buckets, but it should be tailored to the buckets
and actions needed forthe applicatiom.
