# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
The EC2 instance for the app server can be moved to the private subnet, while still being connected to the internet via the ALB in the public subnet.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
Since the secret resipes S3 bucket is currently configured to allow public access, creating a VPC endpoint in front of it to only allow access from the VPC 
would restict unauthorized access from the public. It would still allow unauthorized access from resources within the VPC id they are not configured correctly.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, objects that were put into the S3 bucket before SSE encryption was enabled will still be unencrypted afterwards.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
Resources that are configured via the CloudFormation template will be re-configured to the inital state. Resources that have been manually added (e.g. a private VPC endpoint)
will stay in place. The encryption state of S3 objects is untouched.
