RTO estimate

There are several events and actions that take similar amounts of time both in the single-AZ and region outage cases:
Alert triggering (5 min), triggering on-call staff (1 min), staff getting ready and logging in (10 min), diagnosing the issue (5 min) and discovering the root cause (10 min).
However, the time for remediation between the two cases will be different. For the single-AZ case, the (multi-AZ) database is automatically failed-over, but another AZ might be added (10 min).
In the multi-region case, either the replica has to be made active and all applications must be redirecte to it, or another replica has to be created (30 min).

1. Min RTO for single AZ outage:        45min
2. Min RTO for single region outage:    1h30min

RPO estimate

In the single AZ case, there is no data loss as the database is running in a multi-AZ configuration. In the single region failure, if the secondary region fails there is also no data loss.
Howeverm if the primary region fails, application data can't reach the DB until the applications have been redirected to the activated replica.

3. Min RPO for single AZ outage:        0min
4. Min RPO for single region outage:    0min (secondary fails) / 1h30min (primary fails)
